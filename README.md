Statisticians often rely on mean squared of errors to assess how well an estimation is, and we can mathematically show that the best prediction by mean-squared error is the expected value of the random variable. Also it worths our attention that the equation of Y = beta * X + e implies a causal model where X is the cause and Y is an effect. In addition, we should be aware of the bias-variance trade-off when analyzing linear regressions.

Q: What is bias and what is variance?
A: sigma square is the variance and it is the "unpredictable, 'statistical' fluctuation around even the best prediction(Shalizi)
